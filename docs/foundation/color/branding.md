Branding colors should be used in design for marketing and communications.

---

# Primary

Our primary brand colors are white and Supernova black. The contrast between them is essential for our branding. They represent two different worlds of designers and developers we managed to interface. They are also used to provide accessibility, simplicity, and consistency throughout all brand communications.

# Accent

In limited use, red conveys the energy, excitement, and disruption of Supernova. It is reserved for elements which should grab attention, such as CTAs or links. It stands out from our primary and secondary colors to show what's important right away. Avoid using red in large surfaces.

# Secondary
