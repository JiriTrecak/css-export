# Core Messaging

Supernova connects designers and developers so they can achieve maximum communication, explore pixel-perfect precision, and push the boundaries of product design — at light speed. We want to be known as the standard of excellence for design systems and code generation.

To fulfill our company values, our content is:

### *Clear*

 Recognizable, scannable, and easily understandable. Try to limit each sentence to one idea. If anything, be clear. Reduce the mental load on our users so they can accomplish their goals faster.

### Aspirational

Pioneering the future of product design and collaboration is what gets us up in the morning. Our content should be full of energy — upbeat, hopeful, and ambitious.

### Supportive

Every piece of content should serve a clear purpose, be helpful, and add value. Continually ask, “What information needs to be included now? Why?” As Metts and Welfle put it in Writing is Designing, it’s not just about omitting needless words. Instead, “omit needless information” — while meeting user needs.

### Inclusive

As an interdisciplinary tool that eliminates misalignment, we make sure to consider all sides, avoid colloquial terms, gender-specific pronouns, or language that implies something is "easy" or "simple." When in doubt, reference this.
