# Voice and tone

---

There’s what we say, our message. Then there’s how we say it, our voice. Casually, you could describe Supernova’s voice as “a NASA mission to Mars, but with a human element.” 

## Voice

Supernova’s voice is:

- *Visionary* — We're focused on excellence. We’re thinking several steps ahead. We’re proud of our product, the work we’ve put into it, and love sharing it with the world. We’re not shy about describing the ways we’re pioneering the possibilities of fast-moving code generation and product team collaboration. 

- *Unifying* — At our core, we’re inclusive, not exclusive. We’re bringing different worlds together: designers and developers. We keep things approachable and conversational by writing in plain English (avoid jargon, hyperbole, vagueness, corporate lingo, etc.). Never sacrifice clarity for cleverness.

- *Supportive* — Always make it about our customers. We recognize that we’re building new, innovative tools that will be used by product teams around the world. Our users need our support, clarity, and foresight. We believe every customer deserves care and attention, and our commitment to customer support and user research bears that out. 

- *Dynamic* — We’d be lying if we stifled our enthusiasm about the possibilities of we’re creating with our products. We’re making teams stronger, allowing specializations to flourish, and helping our users by automating the time-consuming tasks that developers and designers deal with. Supernova is a superpower. And we’re just getting started.
