- *Pioneering* — We help solve mission-critical problems. We’re always innovating, moving ahead, and exploring cutting-edge technologies. 

- *Unifying* — As an interdisciplinary tool that brings together designers and developers, we believe in the shared mission. We believe in product hygiene and team alignment.

- *Production-ready* — We’re constantly iterating, validating, and questioning the status quo. Our code is clean, customizable, and ready for liftoff.

- *Exceed* — Exceed expectations at every opportunity. We want the same unprecedented delight behind our product to seep into everything we do.
