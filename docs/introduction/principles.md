> Our end goal is to *close the gap between designers and developers so they can automate, innovate, and accomplish their shared mission faster than ever before.*

Our core values are the driving force behind this goal:

- *Human *— Customer success is our north star. Our goal is to foster an environment where our users have the full support they need to push the boundaries of product design.

- *Pioneering* — We help solve mission-critical problems. We’re always innovating, moving ahead, and exploring cutting-edge technologies. 

- *Unifying* — As an interdisciplinary tool that brings together designers and developers, we believe in the shared mission. We believe in product hygiene and team alignment.

- *Production-ready* — We’re constantly iterating, validating, and questioning the status quo. Our code is clean, customizable, and ready for liftoff.

- *Exceed* — Exceed expectations at every opportunity. We want the same unprecedented delight behind our product to seep into everything we do.
