# Checkbox

---

Checkboxes allow users to select one or more items from a set. Checkboxes can be used to turn an option on or off.

> If you have multiple options appearing in a list, you can preserve space by using checkboxes instead of on/off switches. If you have a single option, avoid using a checkbox and use an on/off switch instead.
