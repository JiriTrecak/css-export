# Image List

---

We allow for two different image layouts - masonry and woven lists.

## Woven image list

Woven image lists use alternating container ratios to create a rhythmic layout. A woven image list is best for browsing peer content.

## Masonry image list

Masonry image lists use dynamically sized container heights that reflect the aspect ratio of each image. This image list is best used for browsing uncropped peer content.
